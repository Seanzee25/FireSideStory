    <p>It was a dark and stormy night, four teenagers were hanging out together in a log cabin in the middle of the woods... <br>
       and they encountered a magical frog!</p>
    <p>They knew that it was magical because it started talking to them. The frog said: "There is a treasure hidden somewhere inside this cabin"</p>
    <p>The group proceeded to search the cabin until dawn, realizing that there was no treasure at all! They've been tricked...</p>
